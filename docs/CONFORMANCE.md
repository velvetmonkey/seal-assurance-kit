# Conformance

Seal's deployment claim is byte identity over a corpus, not a theorem about every possible input.

The acceptance bridge lives in `seal-host/scripts/conformance_bridge.mjs`. Over its corpus it checks:

- decision and audit bytes agree across the interpreted Lean model, the native `.so` entry point, and (under `--wasm`) the rebuilt wasm artifact, on every route;
- the SHA-256 record chain re-derives identically across those bodies, independently re-derived in JavaScript by `seal-host/scripts/seal_log.mjs`;
- a freshly spawned deployed `seal-host-rs` emits a record chain that agrees with the model.

The target commitment is lowercase 64-hex SHA-256 over `encodeParts(parts)`, where each part is framed as `<charCount>:<part>` using Lean/String code-point count, then encoded as UTF-8 before hashing. This is intentionally separate from the legacy UInt64 `certHash` audit helper.

What conformance says: for the corpus, the bodies emit byte-identical target hashes, decisions, audit bytes, and record chain heads.

What it does not say: Rust, wasm, JavaScript, browsers, compilers, or operating systems are proven correct for every possible input.
